##Summary
My goals are pretty boring, when I was a kid
I really enjoyed being around my PC, play games,
watch cartoons, just talk to people through internet.
I didn't get tired from sitting at my PC for 5-8 hours straight.
Then I found out about about programming and thought
I'd give it a try. I really liked it, but it was scary
for me at the beginning because I thought I'm not capable of
understanding all sort of things in programming so I stopped.

But during last summer I decided to give it another try, and here I am trying get myself into
Web-Development.
