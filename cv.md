## Summary
My goals are pretty boring, when I was a kid
I really enjoyed being around my PC, play games,
watch cartoons, just talk to people through internet.
I didn't get tired from sitting at my PC for 5-8 hours straight.
Then I found out about about programming and thought
I'd give it a try. I really liked it, but it was scary
for me at the beginning because I thought I'm not capable of
understanding all sort of things in programming so I stopped.

But during last summer I decided to give it another try, and here I am trying get myself into
Web-Development.


## Skills
I've been learning __JavaScript__ for about 6 months,
after that I started digging into frameworks and learnt about __React__ and __Redux__
Also before learning __JS__ I started to learn __HTML__ and __CSS__
and combined it with __BEM__ methodology.

## Code Examples

[Twitter](https://github.com/skromez/twitter) - made with __React__, __Redux__, __Axios__ and
__Styled Components__.  

[Dayaxe](https://github.com/skromez/dayaxe) - simple landing page with some vanilla JS.

## Experience
Currently I'm an __Intern JavaScript Developer__, doing my Internship in IT Company called __We//Yes__
It's already 4th month of my internship, so I've made some projects and I listed them above in __Code Example__ section.
Before that I finished __Web-Development__ course on [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com)

## Education
Right now im on 4th grade in college, and my major is __Computer Science.__

## English
I learnt english from playing and watching movies, I'd say my english level is between B1 and B2.
I've been practicing talking english with my english-speaking friends when we were playing games for about 1 year.
